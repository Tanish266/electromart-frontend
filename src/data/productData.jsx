              is wide open. Which is not what you would expect at all from
              closed circumaural headphones. With the HD 820 you can explore and
              rediscover your music in absolute reference-class quality without
              intruding on the aural comfort zone of others. Thus, the HD 820
              not only open up the sound field, but also new places and
              opportunities for you to enjoy your music.

            <p>
              The breakthrough transparent performance of the HD 820 has been
              achieved through a special innovation: Their legendary Sennheiser
              Ring Radiator transducers are fitted with unique glass covers.
              Revealing the great look of the technical component within, this
              visually striking feature was actually developed wholly in service
              to the sound: The concave glass reflects the sound waves from the
              rear of the transducer to an absorber, which results in minimal
              resonance. Thus, the sound waves are effectively “gone” like they
              would be in open headphones.

            <p>
              Made in Germany, the HD 820 stand apart also because of the
              extraordinary attention that is given to every detail: From the
              extra comfortable handcrafted ear pads that insulate the listener

              gold-plated plugs, to the robust metal headband with an inner
              damping element. This package offers an unparalleled listening
              experience, which can even be improved by the Sennheiser HDV 820
              amplifier for dynamic headphones – the perfect companion to the HD
